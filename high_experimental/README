This directory is to store all atempts to do something too hard or complex.

The first usage for this directory is a atempt to create entirelly with python a accoustic phonetic toolkit (Like praat).

Start trying to use esps.py (http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kgorman/papers/esps.py), esps (http://www.speech.kth.se/software/) and pstat (http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/Neural_Systems_Group/gary/python/pstat.py)

Some information about TextGrid is available in esps.py and in SpeedCluster (http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~cbs007/speechCluster/README.html)

Ive advanced a little in my speech analysis algorithm research. Ive discovered libsnack (http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/) can extract nativelly the formants and pitch, and i need now see if it will be precise enough. About ESPS, its really hard to compile it, because it even know what linux is. If someone know a way to compile it on linux, please tell-me. :]

LPC-PARCOR-CEPSTRUM folder is a C version for cepstrum f0 extraction

cepstrum.py is a new code using numpy. Currently only extracts the f0 mean from entire file.
cepstrum_snack.py is a attempt to do the same using Snack. unfortunelly it dont works yet

The new dir called mvuorine is the python code from Mikko P Vuorinen <mvuorine[whereismyspam?]cc.helsinki.fi> and its working *VERY* well. Its today my reference to make code, but i aim to make cepstrum.py (using numpy) do the same.

EVERYTHING inside this folder, and this project is licenced by GPLv2.
