Welcome to setfon trunk!

This is a little brief of what you ill find here.

beatextractor is a piece of code for automatic segmentation.
DOC is a folder with a lot of papers and important links (Mainly from high_experimental research)
high_experimental is a attempt to re-create all sound processing tools needed by a speech analisys. As this svn basically only receives commit from me (leleobhz), can be said this is the mainline of SVN code.
praatwrapper is a code for wrap praat code to python. Unsucessfull attempt since praat does not suport formulas, language elements and a lot of things from interactive commandline (And i refuse to create temporary scripts).
utils is a collection of related applications, but not directly involved in main setfon development tree.

As i wrote, this svn repository is basically (Until now, Wed, 17 Sep 2008 08:42:05 -0300) only used by me, and my code is officialy considerated a parallel (un?)official work, so if trunk control changes and you like my code, try find something in www.leleobhz.org (Surelly ill take this code away from this SVN if this happen)

Any questions, mail-me leleobhz[whereismyspam???]leleobhz.org
